# Daily_Planner
This webpage uses HTML, CSS, JS and JQuery to create a Daily Planner that will save your plans for each hour and is color cordinated based on what time it is in your timezone. This works by using moment() and checking the hour against the id's named in the time-blocks (green = furture, red = present, grey = past). A for loop was used to loop through the different time-blocks and put text saved in the localStorage into the appropriate spot. Whenever the SaveBtn is pressed, the localStorage will be updated with whatever is (or isn't) in the textarea.
